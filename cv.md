## Short biography
---

I started my study in Electronics and Computing Engineering at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in January 2011. Then, I was selected to participate on a Brazilian Government project called Science Without Borders, studying one year (July 2013 - May 2014) in Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago, Illinois. When I returned to Brazil, I joined the Laboratory of Signals, Multimedia, and Telecommunications (SMT), starting my interest in the area of signal processing. In the second quarter of 2016 I started in the machine learning field, studying similarity-based methods to automatically detect faults on rotation machines, originating my B.Sc. final project. Then, I joined the M.Sc. course from COPPE/UFRJ in the Electrical Engineering Program (PEE) with an emphasis in machine learning, which I developed my M.Sc. dissertation on failure detection on Oil & Gas offshore platforms using Machine Learning. I'm currently doing my D.Sc. in the same program and my current focus is study Bayesian Methods, specially the ones used in Deep Learning.
